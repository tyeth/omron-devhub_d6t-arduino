# d6t-2jcieev01-arduino
It is a sample projects for D6T OMRON MEMS Thermal Sensors with
evaluation kit **2JCIE-EV01-AR1**,
**2JCIE-EV01-FT1** and some Arduino boards.

D6T sensor series are High Sensitivity Enables Detection
of Stationary Human Presence,

- OMRON's unique MEMS and ASIC technology achieve a high SNR.
- Superior noise immunity with a digital output.
- High-precision area temperature detection with low cross-talk field of
    view characteristics


## Description
this Arduino sample projects for acquiring data from sensors on 2JCIE-EV01.
sample projects output the sensor data to USB-Serial ports.
